# Meme Generator 

This project was done while following along the tutorial from https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact. It is a web app that receives 100 of the most pupular meme images in the past 30 days using the Imgflip API. A user can then generate their own meme by adding text to these images. 

Lessons Learned:
- states
- hooks (useState() & useEffect())
- conditional rendering
- forms in React
- calling APIs

Ways to improve project:
- allow users to download memes they created
- allow users to share memes they created on some social media sites
- allow users to pick the meme images they want to use instead of having a meme image be randomly chosen for them
- meme images rendered on the page should have alt text based on the name key associated with each meme image from the API for better accessibility
